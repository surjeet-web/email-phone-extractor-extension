## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please send an email to [your-email@example.com] with a detailed description of the vulnerability.

Please do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities as they are public and could potentially be exploited before a fix is released.

## Security Considerations

This Chrome extension:

1. Only runs on pages when the user explicitly activates it
2. Does not collect or transmit any personal data
3. Stores extracted data locally on the user's device
4. Does not communicate with external servers
5. Does not modify web page content in a harmful way

## Best Practices

Users should:

1. Only install the extension from trusted sources
2. Review the source code before installation
3. Keep the extension updated to the latest version
4. Report any suspicious behavior

## Updates

Security updates will be released as needed and will be documented in the CHANGELOG.md file.
